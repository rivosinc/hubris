// additional harts have their own mtimecmp offset at 0x8 intervals from hart0.

// As per FE310-G002 Manual, section 9.1, the address of mtimecmp on
// our supported board is 0x0200_4000, which also matches qemu.
//
// On both RV32 and RV64 systems the mtime and mtimecmp memory-mapped registers
// are 64-bits wide.

//
// To keep things simple, especially on RV32 systems where we cannot atomically
// write to the mtime/mtimecmp memory-mapped registers as they are 64 bits
// wide, we only utilise the first 32-bits of each register, setting the
// high-order bits to 0 on startup, and restarting the low-order bits of mtime
// back to 0 on each interrupt.
